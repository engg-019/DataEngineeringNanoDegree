    "**Why can't everything be stored in a giant Excel spreadsheet?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are limitations to the amount of data that can be stored in an Excel sheet. So, a database helps organize the elements into tables - rows and columns, etc. Also reading and writing operations on a large scale is not possible with an Excel sheet, so it's better to use a database to handle most business functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Does data modeling happen before you create a database, or is it an iterative process?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* It's definitely an iterative process. Data engineers continually reorganize, restructure, and optimize data models to fit the needs of the organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How is data modeling different from machine learning modeling?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning includes a lot of data wrangling to create the inputs for machine learning models, but data modeling is more about how to structure data to be used by different people within an organization. You can think of data modeling as the process of designing data and making it available to machine learning engineers, data scientists, business analytics, etc., so they can make use of it easily.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Key points about Data Modeling \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Organization**: The organization of the data for your applications is extremely important and makes everyone's life easier.\n",
    "* **Use cases**: Having a well thought out and organized data model is critical to how that data can later be used. Queries that could have been straightforward and simple might become complicated queries if data modeling isn't well thought out.\n",
    "* **Starting early**: Thinking and planning ahead will help you be successful. This is not something you want to leave until the last minute.\n",
    "* **Iterative Process**: Data modeling is not a fixed process. It is iterative as new requirements and data are introduced. Having flexibility will help as new information becomes available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Why Data Modeling is Important:\n",
    "Let's take an example from Udacity. Here, a Udacity data engineer would help structure the data so it can be used by different people within Udacity for further analysis and also shared with the learner on the website. For instance, when we want to track the students' progress within a Nanodegree program, we want to aggregate data across students and projects within a Nanodegree. In a relational database, this requires the data to be structured in ways that each student's data is tracked across all Nanodegree programs that s/he has ever enrolled in. The data also needs to track the student's progress within each of those Nanodegree programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data model is critical for accurately representing each data object. For instance, a data table would track a student's progress on project submissions, i.e., whether they passed or failed a specific rubric requirement. Furthermore, the data model should ensure that a student's progress is updated and aggregated to provide an indicator of whether the student passed all the rubric requirements and successfully finished the project. Data modeling is critical to track all of these pieces of data so the tables are speaking to each other, updating the tables correctly (e.g., updating a student's progress on a project submission), and meeting defined rules (e.g., project completed when all rubric requirements are passed).\n",

    "## ACID Transactions\n",
    "Properties of database transactions intended to guarantee validity even in the event of errors or power failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Atomicity**: The whole transaction is processed or nothing is processed. A commonly cited example of an atomic transaction is money transactions between two bank accounts. The transaction of transferring money from one account to the other is made up of two operations. First, you have to withdraw money in one account, and second you have to save the withdrawn money to the second account. An atomic transaction, i.e., when either all operations occur or nothing occurs, keeps the database in a consistent state. This ensures that if either of those two operations (withdrawing money from the 1st account or saving the money to the 2nd account) fail, the money is neither lost nor created. Source [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems)) for a detailed description of this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Consistency**: Only transactions that abide by constraints and rules are written into the database, otherwise the database keeps the previous state. The data should be correct across all rows and tables. Check out additional information about consistency on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_(database_systems)).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Isolation**: Transactions are processed independently and securely, order does not matter. A low level of isolation enables many users to access the data simultaneously, however this also increases the possibilities of concurrency effects (e.g., dirty reads or lost updates). On the other hand, a high level of isolation reduces these chances of concurrency effects, but also uses more system resources and transactions blocking each other. Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems)).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Durability**: Completed transactions are saved to database even in cases of system failure. A commonly cited example includes tracking flight seat bookings. So once the flight booking records a confirmed seat booking, the seat remains booked even if a system failure occurs. Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID).\n",

    "* **Need high availability**: The fact that relational databases are not distributed (and even when they are, they have a coordinator/worker architecture), they have a single point of failure. When that database goes down, a fail-over to a backup system occurs and takes time.\n",

    "1. Transaction logging (retail, health care)\n",

    "* **Large amounts of data**: Relational Databases are not distributed databases and because of this they can only scale vertically by adding more storage in the machine itself.

NoSQL database are eventually consistent and do not provide ACID transactions. However, there are exceptions to it. Some non-relational databases like MongoDB can support ACID transactions.\n",
